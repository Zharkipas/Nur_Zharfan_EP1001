                    <h2>CNC Routing</h2>
                    <p>On this page i have recorded my process of designing and fabricating my table side shelf</p>
                    <h3>The design</h3>
                    <p>Before being able to fabricate a product i had to design it first. I used Fusion 360 for this process</p>
                    <iframe src="https://ichat2312.autodesk360.com/shares/public/SH9285eQTcf875d3c539c063bedcbbbecc94?mode=embed" width="640" height="480" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true"  frameborder="0"></iframe>
                    <p>Since i was using the Large scale cnc router i had to compensate for the 6mm diameter cutter being used to cut my pieces therefore i used a dogbone library found EP1001 website to auto add the additional feature in my design</p>
                    <h3>The Fabrication</h3>
                    <p>Before I started cutting, there were a few things to do. I first had to export my 3D model as 2D faces in a DXF file format, this was simple as fusion allows us to export the different faces on the model as DXF files and all i had to do was comile them into 1 DXF file</p>

                    <p>Next, I had to choose the plywood with the right thickness and screw it down onto the sacrificial board of the CNC machine. Only then did i import my DXF file into VcarvePro onto the machine's computer</p>

                    <p>Afterwards, i programmed the different toolpaths, rezeroed the machine and ensured that all of the settings were in order before starting the machine.</p>

                    <p>After machining the indicidual pieces, i then removed them from the board and sanded them down to remove excess fibres from the piece to have a smoother finish on the pieces. All that was left was to assemble</p>
