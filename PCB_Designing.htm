                    <h2>PCB Designing</h2>
                    <p>On this page i have recorded my process of designing and exporting my "Hello World" PCB design</p>
                    <h3>Software used</h3>
                    <p>I had chosen to use the Eagle sofware by Autodesk as i found it the easiest to use in terms of designing the pcb and also importing different libraries needed for my design</p>
                    <p>Here is the link to the Eagle software:*insert link</p>
                    <h3>Steps taken</h3>
                    <p>I first started by doing the schematic diagram of the desired pcb. This diagram determines how each component is connected to one another</p>
                    <p>insert image</p>
                    <p>Next, I worked on the board design, after switching to the board view i rearranged the components to allow fo the most compact design as to minismise the wastage of materials</p>
                    <p>insert image</p>
                    <p>I had to also ensure that my line thickness was correct and that the corners were not too sharp which could be an issue when machining</p>
                    <p>After finalising the design i ran a checking function in Eagle to ensure that the design had no errors</p>
