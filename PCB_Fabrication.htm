                    <h2>PCB Fabrication</h2>
                    <p>On this page i have recorded my process of fabricating my several PCBs</p>
                    <h3>The preparation</h3>
                    <p>Before fabricating any PCBs i need to start by getting the files ready</p>
                    <p>For my "Hello World" board i had to export the PCB design from Eagle while i obtained the PCB designs for my FTDI and UPDI boards from the elective website</p>
                    <p>As for the "Hello World" I had to export 2 different files for fabrication. The first file is a png file of the traces of the board while the second is a png file of the outline of the board</p>
                    <img src="PCB/Trace.png" alt="navweb" width=350 height=300>
                    <img src="PCB/Outline.png" alt="navweb" width=350 height=300>
                    <p>Next, I imported the png images into the mods software found on the Further Digital Fabrication website</p>
                    <p>With mods, i exported the gcode to CNC route the board onto a thumbdrive and proceeded to the stepcraft machine to fabricate the boards</p>
                    <h3>The machining</h3>
                    <p>At the stepcraft machine, I uploaded the gcode for the traces of the chosen board first and attached a 30 degree cutter to the machine</p>
                    <p>I then had to re-zero the machine and do a air cut to ensure that there were no issues with the program. Once all check were done, I finally started cutting the copper board. After the maching of the traces is completed, i changed out the cutter for a flat endmill to cut out the outline of the board</p>

                    <p>I repeated this process for all 3 boards</p>
                    <p>Lastly, I soldered all of the electronics onto the boards once i finished routing all 3 boards</p>
