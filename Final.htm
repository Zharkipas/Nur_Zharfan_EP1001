                    <h2>The Keypad</h2>
                    <p>On this page i have recorded my process of designing and fabricating my keypad</p>
                    <h3>Designing</h3>
                    <p>I first started with the PCB design and schemetics as to know how my different electronics will link to one another. Once I had the final PCB design, I took its dimensions and started designing the housing for my keypad</p>

                    <iframe src="https://ichat2312.autodesk360.com/shares/public/SH9285eQTcf875d3c5398ab1db47cb1b001b?mode=embed" width="640" height="480" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true"  frameborder="0"></iframe>
                    <h3>Fabrication</h3>
                    <p>Once done with the designs i moved on to fabricating my PCB and keypad housing. I used a variety of methods such as large and small scale CNC and 3D printing</p>

                    <img src="Final/PCB.jpg" alt="navweb" width=350 height=300>
                    <h3>Assembly</h3>
                    <p>With the completion of the fabrication, it was time to put all the parts together. First was soldering the electronics to the PCB i routed and testing that all the parts were not faulty. Next i fitted the switches and PCB into the housing to check that the sizing was correct. Thankfully the dimensions were just nice</p>

                    <img src="Final/Assembly.jpg" alt="navweb" width=350 height=300>
                    <h3>Programming</h3>
                    <p>Now that ive checked for faulty electronics and i know that the individual parts were of the right size, I could start programming my PCB to be a key pad. I utilized a similiar code to my programming assignment earlier in the module to communicate the button pressees on my PCB to my PC to simulate different keyboard presses</p>
